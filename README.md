N-Queens Problem using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Backtracking Algorithm)
The N-Queens problem is a classic puzzle in which the objective is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. A queen can attack any piece that is on the same row, column, or diagonal. The challenge is to find all possible ways to place the queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other.

This project demonstrates how to solve the N-Queens problem using backtracking, a common algorithmic technique for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The solution is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
